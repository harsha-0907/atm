# ATM

This project demonstrates the working of a Real-World ATM. We included features such as Passwords and Transaction History to ensure that the experience is smooth.
A notice to small but intricate details is priotized to give a similar effect.

The accounts.txt file is a must and should be placed in the same directory of the main program.

I am open to any constructive feedback and critisism for the development of this project.

This is run completely on C. 
Please make sure that you have the relevant libraries installed (time).
